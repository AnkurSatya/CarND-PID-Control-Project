    "2. I component. \n",
    "The use of the I component is to remove any internal bias in the vehicle. The I component did not have any significant effect in my PID implmentation which makes sense as we are running a vehicle in a simulator which is basically bias free, until added explicitly.\n",
    "3. D component.\n",
    "The D component tries to the prevent the overshooting by penalising a large change in the cte in a short amount of time. It might happen due to the counter measure given by the P component. It has a smoothning effect on the vehicle movement."
